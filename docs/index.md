# Welcome to Me Adota

## What is Me Adopt?
 
The project is a webapp that facilitates the adoption of pets, especially those in vulnerable situations. 

## How did it start?

Started when our team (Ancient Fiddle) had to choose a project to work in the discipline of **Software Development Methods**, which is taught by Professor **George Marsicano** at the **University of Bras√≠lia**. In a meeting to discuss ideas about what to bring to the project, the idea for Me Adota came up and the whole team was excited about the possible impact that the project could achieve.
